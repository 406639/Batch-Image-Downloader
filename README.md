# Batch-Image-Downloader
### A simple Batch Image Downloader using Python and BeautifulSoup.

Initially it'll take two input from user.
1. An url (from where images will be downloaded)
2. Yes or No (whether user want to download images from sub-pages of the given url)

The program can also use Pyperclip to get the link from your clipboard.
Use image_downloader_clip.py for that purpose.

A directory will be auto generated and images will be downloaded into the directory. If there are more than 50 images, the program will ask for permission to continue or stop the execution.
